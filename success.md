**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vWXbOLmaE" target="_blank">FINISHED NOT PERFECT</a> by Jake Parker**
* Iteration is key.

**HAVE A GOAL AND KEEP IT REALISTIC**
* A well thought out and well executed 10 seconds is infinitely better than a mediocre 5 minutes. Motion graphics is about using time, space and design to maximize your ability to communicate the objective. Longer does not necessarily equal better. Complex does not necessarily equal more effective. 

**STRIVE TO DO YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST**
* Remember FINISHED NOT PERFECT. Besides, perfection is subjective and never obtainable anyway, while attention to detail (i.e. spelling!), ability to convey your objective to your audience, meeting deadlines, and completing the project to requirements ARE NOT subjective. 

**LEARN HOW TO LEARN**
* No one will teach you better than you can teach yourself. Technology moves at a very fast pace and what you know today may not, and chances are will not, be enough tomorrow. Learn to not only “how to learn” but also how to seek out what is out there that may be worth learning - ie: new software, plugins, techniques, inspirations. 

**USE YOUR RESOURCES** 
* The Internet is the quickest access to information you have, but don’t forget that books and magazines offer a wealth of info and inspiration. 

**DO NOT DO YOUR HOMEWORK ALONE**
* Study and do your projects outside of class together. Find a homework partner or group who you can bounce ideas off of, hold feedback sessions, and help you resolve any issues that may occur.  

**GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD** 
* If you do not constantly look at the work of others, you will never grow as a designer as you'll only regurgitate what you are currently capable of. Continuous improvement, not perfection, is the goal. 

**RESEARCH AND DEVELOP YOUR IDEA** 
* Do that before diving in head first into the project! Consider all of the following questions before you settle on a direction:
    * Why do you want to make this? What is your motivation?
    * What is the goal of your project? 
    * Who is your intended audience? Why should they care? What do you want them to experience? How do you want them to feel? What do you want them to learn?
    * Are there cultural/social/historical/creative contexts you need to research?
    * How will you use the synthesis of time and space (composition, color, point/line/shapes/images/type/audio) to communicate your idea? 
    * What's driving your visual choices? 
    * What's driving your aural choices?
    * What's driving your temporal (time) choices? 

**CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN** 
* Color, composition, typography, pacing, rhythm, contrast, tension etc. Try to keep in mind the total vision and how each component affects it, at all times! 

**GIVE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK DURING CRITIQUES**
* Your feedback is vital to the growth of your classmates as well as your OWN creative
development. 

**BE OPEN TO CRITIQUES OF YOUR WORK AND CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM**
* Remember The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, and check your ego at the door! You will never get better if you are unable to deal with your own mistakes, shortcomings and weak spots. 

**ALWAYS REMEMBER: THERE IS ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO DO SOMETHING.**
