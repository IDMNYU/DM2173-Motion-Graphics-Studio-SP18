### MGS Pre-Work

**Your Commitment to this Course**
* If you are prone to saying that "this course is too much work," this course may not be for you. This course will require a LOT of time outside of class AT LEAST 8 to 16 hours every week. You will be able to build some amazing portfolio pieces in this course, but only if you are committed to doing so. 
* This is not a class where you can do the homework the night before. It's actually not physically possible. If this is your mode of operating, I wouldn't recommend this course for you. 
* There are 10 people on the waitlist so if you are not totally committed to this course I'd recommend that you drop the course and find another by consulting with Eric. 
* **I only want students in the class who really want to create amazing work and will push themselves to do so.**

**Letters To The Next Cohort**
You can find letters to you from the previous students who took the course. If you do not want to read all of them, I highly recommended you read the first four which are numbered. You can only access the following drive with an NYU account.

**Syllabus**
* You can find the [syllabus online at gitbook](https://deangela.gitbooks.io/motion-graphics-studio-spring-2018/content/syllabus.html) and pinned on slack.
* Please read carefully before class.
* Let me know if you find any broken links or typos.

**[After Effects Tutorials and Diary](after_effects_diary.md)**
* Begin the after effect tutorials IMMEDIATELY before the semester begins so that you can absorb the material and not be distracted by your other classes. After Effects has a steep learning curve for some so I wouldn't wait to begin these tutorials. 

**Required Book**
* **Moving Type: Designing for Time and Space** by Matt Woolman & Jeff Bellantoni OR **Motion Design** by Matt Woolman. Both are out of print, but purchase whichever is cheaper on amazon.com, ebay.com, etc. Do not buy both. There are many on Amazon that will be anywhere from $4 to $21 including shipping.
    * [Amazon: Moving Type](https://www.amazon.com/Moving-Type-Designing-Time-Space/dp/2880463696/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484081727&sr=8-1&keywords=moving+type) 
    * [Ebay.com: Moving Type](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_productid=1780550&rt=nc&_pmc=true&_sop=15&isRefine=true&LH_ItemCondition=3000%7C4000%7C5000%7C6000&sl_ready=true&_fosrp=1)
* For whatever reason, Motion Design is alwasys more expensive than Moving Type but they are essentially the same book. So again whichever you can find cheaper.
* Motion Design will be placed on course reserves in the Bobst Library.

**Slack Invite (http://bxmc.slack.com)**
* You will be receiving an invitation from Slack by or before Jan. 23rd. Please accept it. I have to manually enter you to the mgs slack channel. Please be patient.
* If you've been in one of my classes before, you'll automatically be added with the username and password you used before with my class.
* I suggest changing your [slack account notification settings](https://bxmc.slack.com/account/notifications) to receive slack notifications via your nyu email so you don't miss any posts. 
    * Customize Your Notification Settings -> Additional Settings -> Email Settings

**Show and Tell**
* After quickly researching [the choices](https://deangela.gitbooks.io/motion-graphics-studio-spring-2018/content/show_and_tells.html), please post on the class main slack channel, mgs_sp18, your show and tell choice. First come first serve.
