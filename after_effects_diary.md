### ASSIGNMENTS: After Effects Diary
 ---

**On a weekly basis, post entries of your after effects diary to the MGS slack channel.** 
* a couple of sentences at most about whether it was helpful or not in explaning x (where x is a variable to substitute whatever motion graphics principle you are learning about), better than another tutorial or book at explaining x, etc. It doesn't have to be an entire paragraph.
* Be as specific as possible. Post URLs, titles and authors of online tutorials or books. Often you do not complete the entire course in one sitting so be specific about what section(s) of the course you are referring to.
* **Throughout the semester, the professor will ask you to share with the entire class what you've learned from a specific after effects diary entry.**

Your diary should chronicle: 
* what online tutorials you have viewed and completed and/or 
* what chapters within after effects books you have actually read and/or done the exercises from.

---
* Begin the after effect tutorials IMMEDIATELY before the semester begins so that you can absorb the material and not be distracted by your other classes. After Effects has a steep learning curve for some so I wouldn't wait to begin these tutorials. 

Choose between AETUTS or Lynda. I highly recommend AETUTS. It covers everything you need to know clearly, concisely, and quickly.

**AETUTS:**
* [AE TUTS](ae_tuts.md)

Even though AETUTS will apply to a different version of After Effects. After Effects' interface and functionality really hasn't changed all that much and everything still applies.
